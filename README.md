Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create an effective machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. By leveraging historical data and customer features, the model will assist the bank in identifying at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention strategies.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Obtain a comprehensive dataset containing customer information, transaction history, and whether they churned or not.
Data Exploration:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, size, and features.
Visualize the distribution of features and investigate potential patterns related to customer churn.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables and preprocess numerical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the dataset.
Create new features that might enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate classification models for predicting churn, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training dataset.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset.
Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualize the confusion matrix to understand model strengths and weaknesses.
